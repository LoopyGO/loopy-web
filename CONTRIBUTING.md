- Priority is the best User Experience
- Complexity should be introduced when it’s inevitable
- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Avoid abstracting too early
- Avoid thinking too far in the future

## Preparing a Pull Request

[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) are always welcome, but before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with maintainers.

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies and run validation
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`
